## Switch xxx not work or the vfox use  command does not work ?

If your shell prompt `Warning: The current shell lacks hook support or configuration. It has switched to global scope
automatically` that means you do not hook `vfox` into your shell, please hook it manually first.

Please refer to [Quick Start#_2-hook-vfox-to-your-shell](./quick-start.md#_2-hook-vfox-to-your-shell) to manually hook `vfox` into your shell.
