## Introduction

VersionFox is a cross-platform tool for managing SDK versions. It allows you to quickly install
and switch between different versions of SDKs using the command line.
SDKs are provided as plugins in the form of Lua scripts. This means you can implement your own SDK sources or use
plugins shared by others to install SDKs. It all depends on your imagination. ;)

## Why use VersionFox?

- **cross-platform support** (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- single CLI for multiple languages
- **consistent commands** to manage all your languages
- support **Global**、**Project**、**Session** scopes when switching versions
- simple **plugin system** to add support for your language of choice
- **automatically switches** runtime versions as you traverse your project
- shell completion available for common shells (Bash, Zsh, Powershell)
- **it's faster than `asdf-vm`, and offers more simple commands and genuine cross-platform unification.** see [What-is-the-difference-with-asdf?](https://github.com/version-fox/vfox/wiki/What-is-the-difference-with-asdf%3F)
